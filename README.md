# companion-module-bbc-raven

This is a companion module for a 'Raven' video server.

Companion is a really nice bit of open source software which extends the functionality 
of Elgato Streamdeck devices.

* **Companion**: https://bitfocus.io/companion/
* **Streamdeck**: https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck

Raven is only available if you work for the BBC (sorry guys).

This module allows you control most aspets of a raven server.
If you find a missing feature, please raise an issue on github.
